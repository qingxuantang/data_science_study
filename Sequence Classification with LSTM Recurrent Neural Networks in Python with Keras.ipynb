    "Sequence classification is a predictive modeling problem where you have some sequence of inputs over space or time and the task is to predict a category for the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>What makes this problem difficult is that the sequences can vary in length, be comprised of a very large vocabulary of input symbols and may require the model to learn the long-term context or dependencies between symbols in the input sequence.</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, you will discover how you can develop LSTM recurrent neural network models for sequence classification problems in Python using the Keras deep learning library.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading this post you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>1.How to develop an LSTM model for a sequence classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.How to reduce overfitting in your LSTM models through the use of dropout.<br>\n",
    "3.How to combine LSTM models with Convolutional Neural Networks that excel at learning spatial relationships.</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Kick-start your project with my new book Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing, including step-by-step tutorials and the Python source code files for all examples.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Problem Description</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that we will use to demonstrate sequence learning in this tutorial is the IMDB movie review sentiment classification problem. Each movie review is a variable sequence of words and the sentiment of each movie review must be classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Large Movie Review Dataset (often referred to as the IMDB dataset) contains 25,000 highly-polar movie reviews (good or bad) for training and the same amount again for testing. The problem is to determine whether a given movie review has a positive or negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected by Stanford researchers and was used in a 2011 paper where a split of 50-50 of the data was used for training and test. An accuracy of 88.89% was achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras provides access to the IMDB dataset built-in. <h2>The imdb.load_data() function allows you to load the dataset in a format that is ready for use in neural network and deep learning models. 【自己导入数据是可能存在问题，因为未必是能直接用于nn的格式】</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "The words have been replaced by integers that indicate the ordered frequency of each word in the dataset. The sentences in each review are therefore comprised of a sequence of integers.【全都数字化，便于分析】\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Word Embedding</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will map each movie review into a real vector domain, a popular technique when working with text called word embedding. This is a technique where words are encoded as real-valued vectors in a high dimensional space, where the similarity between words in terms of meaning translates to closeness in the vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras provides a convenient way to convert positive integer representations of words into a word embedding by an Embedding layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>We will map each word onto a 32 length real valued vector.</h2> We will also limit the total number of words that we are interested in modeling to the 5000 most frequent words, and zero out the rest. Finally, the sequence length (number of words) in each review varies, so we will constrain each review to be 500 words, truncating long reviews and pad the shorter reviews with zero values.【可能qt也可以参考：每段完整range的长度都不同，把他们整理成相同长度的sequence用于分析】\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have defined our problem and how the data will be prepared and modeled, we are ready to develop an LSTM model to classify the sentiment of movie reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start off by importing the classes and functions required for this model and initializing the random number generator to a constant value to ensure we can easily reproduce the results.\n"
